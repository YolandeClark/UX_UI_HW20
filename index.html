          <h3>What I Did</h3>
          <p>
            As part of user research I teamed up with one other person to establish a 
research question and objectives to be reached through interviews.I then conducted user interviews 
and combined my finding with my research partner. Together we created an affinity 
diagram, synthesised our findings and developed an empathy map. With this I then created a user persona.

From there I worked alone in the Ideation and definition phase. I brainstormed ideas from the research and ranked these in a priority matrix.

I then established a value proposition followed by the user journey and storyboard.
This set me up to then create a paper prototype which I then made as a wireframe in Figma. From here I wasable to conduct user tests.

In my last week I created a mid definition, 
iteration of my prototype.

          <h3>Research</h3>
          <p>
            Our team began planning the interview by establishing the research question followed by three objectives. 
            Following these objectives we crafted twelve questions to be asked of our interviewees. Consideration to 
            the original research question was present throughout this process.
             The next step was to find 4 to 6 participants to be interviewed. People who consider travel as a significant part of 
            their life were our targets to be interviewed.
            This resulted in 5 successful interviews with a range of potential users.

            Following the completion of the affinity diagram and generating a user Persona I began the brainstorm process
            As part of my ideation I brainstormed ideas using the I like, I wish, What if method.

          <h3>User Testing and Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            User Tests Key Findings
            After conducting around three User tests I was able to gather information of where problems were encountered with the prototype. 
            The Log in / Sign up process proved to be confusing along with some navigation and UI issues around the homepage and Covid Search panel.
            Priority of what iterations must be made was measured on this 2x2 Prioritisation Matrix.
            Navigation and refining the Log In/ Sign Up process was the highest priority.
            Iterations Made based on User Tests; Refinement of the Login and Sign up process to eliminate confusion, Adding extra screens   
            to facilitate the extra steps needed to enable the user to sign in and customise with ease and The Covid Search feature was elaborated upon
            to become a more meaningful feature

          <h3>High Fidelity Prototype Adventure Hub</h3>
          <p>
            Finally I produced a High-Definition Prototype
            This case study was a good introduction to UX Design.
            The research and interviewing components opened up a completely new
            Method and process in which to design and create.
            The project provided new ways in which to work and I know have better knowledge of UX Design language and Terms that are important.
